hackweek, which can be found at:

http://147.2.207.135:8080

We focused on the main function parts in hackweek 6 duration, and we will
focus more in backend security, database validation, bug fix and function
improvement in the future.

FUTURE

        With the functions which a user can typical attend an activity to
        vote, view voting results and export the results to ODF document, we
        still got several features to be improved in the future:

        - code base refarctory

                * use fixture to manage data

                * unify static contents to media directory

                * use similar things with 'snoek.library.context_processors.custom_proc' to avoid transfer settings in each view.

                * Refactorizing of activitiy creation page

        - function Part

                * Allow vote sponsor to duplicate an existed activity
                  (all the votes got copied and the voter infomation
                   got cleared up)

                * Allow vote sponsor hide the overall results from UI, allow
                  voters to show as anonymous voter.

                - Support richer text area for activity descriptions/vote questions. Allow
                  add links to questions in activity creating phase.

                - allow Activities creater to *EDIT* votes and questions as
                  many as they want (rather than fixed number of votes and
                  questions)

                - Allow to search activities by creation date, deadline, etc.

                - Connect to Novell LDAP authentication and support user group

                - Password recall (send mail)

                - Send spam mail to push user vote when an activity is about
                  to expired

                - When edit an activity's question item, we should allow the
                  activity creater choosing to Remove related vote or NOT. The
                  current mechanism removed all of the questions forcely when
                  editing a question's content.

                - Vote in a specific range of users (individuals, groups)

                - Interview arrangement module (contact: yfjiang)

                    The interview arrangement module is designed for
                    scheduling and supervising employee interview status.

                    It should be able to:

                        - Schedule interviewee's information schedule into a
                          particular time slot in a explicit calendar.

                        - The information inside a timeslot of the calendar should include:

                            - interviewee CV attachment
                            - interviewee name
                            - interviewee sex
                            - interviewee contact info: email / phone number
                            - target position
                            - Round of interview is the candidate going
                              to participate. (1st/2nd/3rd...)
                            - Status of the interview: pending?pass?fail?
                            - Interviewer's avialability of the timeslot.
                            - Interviewer's name and comments of the interview.

                        - We should allow shchedule admin to search for the
                          history information of a particular candidate, for
                          example: if a candidate has ever attended a
                          interview long time before?

                    In snoek git repo, the mockup/interview-timeslot.ots is
                    the libreoffice template we are using to track employee
                    interview schedule and status. It could be something we
                    initialize the design of this Snoek module.

                - Novell LDAP account. Using for admin and mail account.

                - Mail to notification.

                - Appointmant mail investigate (contact: nwang, ysun)

                - More friendly ui of 'who vote for what' (contact: yfjiang)
                
                - Login page photo wall

                  Initiating the wall with, say 5x4 size blocks of photos,
                  hooking an "upload your artwork" button somewhere, if one
                  uploads a photo, it replaces a random photo of the existed
                  ones.

                  Each photo on the wall is tagged with "Author" and "Life
                  time". The "author" is the uploader and the "lifetime" shows
                  the days the photo survives in the wall.

                  Several Internet etiquette should be considered here
                  (thanks weihua and weijiang ):

                  * limited permission for the uploader continuously populates
                    stuff on the wall to occupy every space :-) Especially
                    by using script.

                  * limited permission for inappropriate photo content (things
                    look unusal by ordinary people)

                  * limited permission to forbidden to populate the same photo
                    repeatedly to make a marvelous view of the page.

                  * encourage to upload images in a creative way

        - UI

                - Better UI designed with CSS and jquery

                - Display activity creation date/time in front page

                - Front page category view of activity list

                - Front page paginate view of activity list

                - Display the total vote number in the activity display page

                - bar chart of the statistics when reviewing voting results

                - Populate 'Who vote for what' table to odf file as well

                - Front page view of meeting room module.

KNOWN ISSUES:

        - The activity name cannot have '/', otherwise download odf will be failed

        - base1.html will cause severe performance issue in some firefox(3.6.6) as I noticed.
        <div id="page-background"><img src="{{settings.MEDIA_URL}}image/final_most_green_rc2.png" width="100%" height="100%" alt="Smile"></div>

        - Front page view of meeting room will probably show irregularly with specific web browser under certain resolution.
