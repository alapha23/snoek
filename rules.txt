## openSUSE.Asia Summit Logo design contest rules

* The voting will happen on the site deploying Snoek-opensuse.asia special edition:

    http://vote.suse.org.cn

* Snoek will allow you to vote for:

    * The most favorite logo (score 4)
    * The secondly favorite logo (score 2)
    * The thirdly favorite logo (score 1)

The score will be explained in the list item immediately after.

* The way to caculate the winner logo will be by adding the scores:

    * the most favorite logo x score 4 x per vote
    * the secondly favorite logo x score 2 x per vote
    * the thirdly favorite logo x score 1 x per vote

Voters will be allowed to vote for the same logo across all the three
levels of favorite items. For example, a user votes for "No.1
candidate logo" in all the 3 levels, the "No.1 candidate logo" would
get 7 (4 + 2 +1) score.

A voter can only vote once per person :-)
